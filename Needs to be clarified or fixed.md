1.Claude, you said: "Email delivery requires the Cloudflare Worker deployment to complete the chain." Does that mean that there are still tasks that needs to be done? If yes, please go ahead.
2.If the user clicks the link "Meld av" from the the Budbringer newsletter they are redericted to a webpage I have defined. A page on my website https://forvarelset.tazk.no. On this specific page (https://forvarelset.tazk.no/page/meld-av/) I plan to add some suitable text/content. At least: Info to inform that the user has been successfully unsubscribed and that all their data (including their email) has been removed from Budbringer (everywhere). I want to add a list of all relevant places (systems/solutions) their data was stored and now removed from. With info about the purpose of storing their data in each of these places. This shall match the info I plan to add to a privacy statement for Budbringer. When I did a test and clicked this URL I was redirected here: https://forvarelset.tazk.no/page/meld-av/unsubscribe?email=lene.zachariassen%40gmail.com&signature=151b7e09ca43415a86984f90494d3cf4dbf1481faa313dd7fd6984a0a5704ae1

Can you:
1.Make sure clicking this link actually do what I want (add functions wherever needed)
2.Provide me with all info I need to add to the "Meld av" page and privacy statement?
